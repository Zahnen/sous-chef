_Sous Chef simplifies the art of making food. Sous Chef is a straightforward recipe manager that helps declutter online recipes & simplify the process of keeping them. Sous Chef was developed while studying at Epicodus as my final solo project for the program and makes use primarily of ReactJS & Node.js/Express_

## üîß Setup/Installation Instructions

### If you would like to run the webpage locally

* _Open your git-capable command line program (I recommend Terminal on Mac or Git Bash on PC)_
* _Ensure you are within the directory you'd like the file to be created in._
* _Enter the command `git clone https://github.com/Zahnen/sous-chef` in your command line_
* _Once cloned, use the `cd ` command to navigate to the directory created in the previous step._
* _You must have node.js installed in order to run the webpage successfully. If you do not have node.js installed, find more information and download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)_
* _Once in the newly cloned directory, run `npm install` (at the root level of the directory) and a second time (while within the client directory) to install the necessary packages and dependencies._
* _To open the webpage in your default browser, run "$ npm start" in *both* the client and server directories._

## ‚ùó Known Bugs/Issues

* _Loading the /myrecipes route will throw an error if firebase is unable to access the user's UID before the page is rendered._
* _There are limited alerts/redirects after submits, meaning navigation is sometimes counter intuitive_
* _Adding a recipe without a photo will throw an error_


If you come across any other bugs, please let me know by [emailing me](mailto:zahnen@gmail.com).

## üåü Stretch Goals

Sous Chef was developed to help non-professionals develop/adapt recipes in an intuitive way. In future iterations, Sous Chef will include versioning/version control for recipes to easily track how modifications to a recipe may have affected their outcomes. Outside of this larger endevour, Sous Chef also hopes to be a bit more user friendly in terms of redirecting with form submissions/on-screen alerts.
